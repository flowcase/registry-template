# Flowcase Registry Template

This README provides instructions on how to use the Flowcase Registry Template to create your own registries that work with Flowcase.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the Flowcase Registry Template repository.
2. Open the `registry-template` directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Customize the registry by modifying the `droplets.json` file.
4. Deploy the registry to GitHub Pages or another hosting service to make it accessible online.
5. Add the registry as a source in your Flowcase admin dashboard.

## Customizing the Registry

To customize the droplets (applications or services) available in your registry, you can edit the `droplets.json` file. This file includes details such as the image path, display name, Docker container registry, Docker image, and a description for each droplet. You can also customize the name of your registry by editing the `info.json` file. This file contains the name of your registry, which is displayed in the Flowcase interface.
